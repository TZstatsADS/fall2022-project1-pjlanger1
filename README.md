### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Fall 2022

+ Projec title: Peter Langer's Data Science Python Notebook
+ This project is conducted by Peter Langer

+ Project summary: In analyzing a corpus of philosophy data there are numerous angles that can be taken.
+ I chose to explore topic modeling as well as clustering according to autoregressive patterns within the authors' sentiment throughout the text.
+ I Leverage LDA, k means on autocovariance parameters to this end.
+ These methods yielded many interesting insights RE: shared lineage in philosophy.
